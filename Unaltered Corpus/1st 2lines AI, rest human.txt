You are Matilda, a witch living on the edge of the medieval kingdom of Larion. You have a wand and a pet alligator named Ornopinth. As you sit in your swamp hut mixing a magical potion, you hear a knock at the door. You open it and see
 a large ghoulish man, horribly disfigured and looking at you with dead eyes. "You've been terrorizing the villagers of Gorgok, and I've been sent to bring you back to justice."
-----
You tell the ghoulish man "No."
He scoffs at you, and charges into your hut. You narrowly avoid him, and you grab your staff leaning on the doorway.
You declare a spell out loud, and at once, the man's movements stop. He falls onto the floor, clearly in pain.
"I'm terrorizing no one. I was attacked myself!" You tell the man.
He struggles to turn and look at you, and you can't help but to laugh a little bit. "That's rude, lady."
 He says. "My name is Matilda, you brute." You say. He gives you a sly smile.
"Why are you smiling at me?" You ask him.
"Why, I'd never seen a purty lady like yourself." He responds flirtatiously.
You cover your face, which is blood red from the embarassment.
You turn over to him, and lift his face up. "Ornopinth, dinner time!" You call out to your pet alligator. At once, Ornopinth runs over to the man and starts biting through his flesh.
"No one embarasses me." You say, leaving the man to be devoured.
You decide to go to the village of Gorgok, to figure out why your name is being slandered like that. It's rude of those pesky villagers to treat you like this, and some retribution is in order.
You see the town, and it's all in shambles.
One villager is crying next to a burning house.
A piece of wood falls over and crushes the villager. You choose to ignore him.
"Matilda!" You hear.
You turn around and look in that direction to see a fellow witch.
"Hey, Wicke! Long time no see!" You say to the witch. You give her a hug and she returns it in full.
"What do you say we take care of the rest of these dumb villagers?" She asks you. You look around at the townsfolk and see that they are all cowering in fear.



You laugh at the prospect of inflicting further harm to them.
"Let's do it, sis!" You say to Wicke.
Wicke charges up a spell and her oaken staff begins to glow.
A fireball emerges from the tip of her staff, and it blasts at the villagers.
You begin chanting your own spells, seeing how much fun she is having.
Your spell gives life to the shadows. At once, they start grabbing at the feet of the helpless villagers.
No one can save them now.
"Only I can save them!" A voice bellow from just beyond the horizon. You and Wicke see a man wearing golden armor, without a flaw.
"Stop this at once, or you shall taste my blade!" The man points a golden sword at Wicke.
She laughs and chants a spell. At once, his sword melts.
The man, without any hesitation, pulls out another sword from another sheath.
You mimic Wicke's words carefully, and his second sword also melts.
The two of you look at each other, and giggle, while holding hands.
"This man is literally worthless! He can't save anyone, including himself!" You gleefully say. The man, now embarassed, bellows a yell and charges at you with his bare fists.
Wicke repeats the spell one more time, and all of his armor melts.
He trips over, and starts screaming in agony. The molten armor is burning his skin.
"So Wicke, what are you doing here anyway?"
 You ask her. She nods and smiles at you.
"You know, just framing you for destroying this here village." You roll your eyes.
"Wicke, you made a brutish man come after me. I was almost scared for a second!" You say sarcastically.
She laughs harder. "You're a tough gal, you know that? No man can stop you."
In your head, you know she's right, but playing along is just too fun. "I'm so weak and helpless, there's no way I can terrorize an entire village. Right?"
You look towards at what is now the remains of Gorgok. You shrug.
"By the way, how's little baby Ornopinth?" Wicke asks you.
"Oh, you know."
"Oh, you know what?" She responds to you.
"Eating a brutish man. It's like mail-in food, but for pet alligators!" You say.
She laughs at you, and kisses you on the nose.
You nearly stumble backwards, shocked by the gesture.
"Wicke! You know I'm saving myself for marriage. You took my nose virginity!" You say to her, giggling incessently.
"Well," she says.
"Well, I can't say anything about the chastity of your nose, but I do know something I can do for you." She goes down onto one knee.
Wicke digs into her pocket, and pulls out a silver ring.
You jump up and down in excitement.
Marriage! You won't be dying alone!
"I would love to marry you, Wicke!" You exclaim. She nods her head and gets up off of the floor.
Wicke holds you in her arms, tenderly carressing your boiled skin.
"I love you, Matilda." She whispers into your ear.
"I love you too, my fireball."
She pulls you into an intense kiss.
 The End! Or is it?
