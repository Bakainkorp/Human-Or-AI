You are Sir Cereal, a knight living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a steel longsword and a wooden shield. You are on a quest to defeat the evil dragon of Larion. You've heard he lives up at the north of the kingdom. You set on the path to defeat him and walk into a dark forest. As you enter the forest you see
 a hawk flying above you."Ah, a hawk!" You say.The hawk doesn't respond.
-----
You say "Why am I talking to a hawk that is flying fifty feet over my head?"
-----
The hawk stops flying and looks at you. "I don't know why I'm talking to a bird, but I'm hungry." You say. The hawk flies away and leaves you alone again.
-----
You look around to find some nice fruits hanging on the numerous trees surrounding you.
-----
 You feel hungry and your belly rumbles. You walk around the forest and discover a large oak tree with numerous fruits hanging from its branches. You see apples, pears, berries, and many other kinds of fruits.
-----
You take out your steel longsword and swipe at the trees for its bountiful harvest.
-----
You take out your sword and slash at the trees vigorously. The sword slashes many off their branches, but a few prove to still be attached to the tree with strong thorns and they hang onto the branches.
-----
You pick up the fallen fruit, and ravenously CONSUME IT ALL LIKE THE SAVAGE YOU ARE.
-----
You devour all the fallen fruit in your hands and then proceed to take off your shirt and coat and use them as bowls for the next fruit you find, which is kind of messy and takes some time.
-----
An old man sees you disrobe your clothes to carry around the fruit in the forest. He looks at you very judgmentally.
You say "Hello, old man. Would you like some fruit I have taken from the forest and am currently holding in my clothes for whatever reason?"
-----
"Hello, boy. Yes, I would love some. May I have some?" He asks.
-----
You wordless hand him your shirt and coat full of berries and pears with a big ol' smile on your face.
-----
He very humbly accepts your fruitfilled clothes and smiles back at you warmly. You feel good about giving this little old man some food.
-----
You say "Old man, was there a dragon north of this forest by any chance? I kinda need to slay him, like... soon."
-----
He looks at you and begins to frown. "North, north of here? No. There was a dragon about two weeks past the south. South, of course." He frowning.
-----
You say "Two weeks past the south. I understand everything in the universe now. Thank you, Mr. Old Man."
-----
You take his hand and begin to run for it, but he calls out to you. "Take care, my boy. And thank you." He watches you run off and then shakes his head at the situation.
-----
In spite of the man's words, you continue on your path north, where you believe the dragon lies. With your masculine chest hairs flowing in the wind, you arrive at a portly village named Yumiah.
-----
 You are relieved to find that many of the shops still have their doors propped open, indicating they might still have some trade going on.
-----
You check your pockets, only to realize that they are filled with fruit instead of gold pieces or dollar bills.
-----
You pull out two apples and put them in your mouth, chewing on them while you look around for signs of the dragon. You notice a sign in front of a general store ."Wanted: One good man."
-----
You say "I'm a good man! I should response to this wanted poster!"
-----
"I'm a good man!" You say loudly, and then proceed to enter the store, flashing your worn out clothes and dirty face.
-----
The store clerk looks at you, and says hesitantly "W-welcome to the Yumiah General Store. A-are you looking for a job?" He whispers to himself "Please, dear lord, please say you are only here to buy something."
-----
You look at him disapprovingly and say "I'm a good man. I want to be on that wanted poster." He looks afraid and turns his eyes away.
-----
"Oh... Oh no..." He says. Another man, who is likely the store manager walks out with a hearty grin on his face. "Ah, yesh, we do indeed need at least one good man. And a good man, you are. Hopefully." He says.
-----
"What are you looking for?
-----
 What do you need a good man like myself to do?" You ask the store manager. You can see the store clerk slap his forehead in disappointment.
-----
"Ah, it's nothing. You'll have to sign up and wait for the recruiters to call you. They will tell you next steps. Best of luck to you, friend."
-----
You triumphantly exit the store, standing outside awkwardly unaware of all the attention you are drawing to yourself, waiting for those fabled recruiters to arrive.
-----
You are dazzled by the lights that surround the outside of what appears to be a milita armory. You haven't seen such bright lights since that time you were in the Mushroom Kingdom. 
You are saved by a man in military garb who approaches you."Are you lost, sir?"
-----
You say "I am not lost, Mr. Military Man. I am here for one singular purpose: to kill the Dragon of Larion. But I appear to be consistently sidetracked by meaningless nonsense along my way. But I am perfectly okay with that! Please, may I join your knightly circle, as a knight of Larion?"
-----
"Uh..." He stutters "well... if you wish..." The man in uniform leads you to a building behind the armory. 
He leads you to somebody who is sitting at a desk. The desks legs are covered with grime and there are papers all over the place. You've had enough of this formal nonsense; you're about to slit the throat of this hapless clerk right here!
-----
Before you lose every semblance of common sense by killing this poor clerk, she speaks up to you: "Are you joining the Knight Army?"
-----
"Uh, yes. The man in uniform over there just led me to him." "Please come with me, then. The other men will get to you when you are called up."
You are finally allowed to leave, but not before some more meaningless small-talk. You're lead into a room with other teenage boys of like-mind. All of you are armed to the teeth.
-----
"What brings all of you here?" You ask one of the boys standing next to you. He does not respond. 
-----
"Hey! Fuckface! Come on, man! Tell me why you're here!" Still, no response. Something about this isn't right.
It is not long before the recruiter returns to speak to you. You didn't even notice him leave, it's like he blends into the background.
"Hello, Sir Kit. I see you're here to join the Knights of Kishak? Well, welcome to the team!" "You're... You're one of them?"
-----
You say "And by the way, my name is Sir Cereal. Not Sir Kit."
-----
"Well then, Sir Kit, I'm sure we'll get along fine." "So what do you want me to do?" He gives a little chuckle. 
"Nothing much, Sir Kit. Just show up tomorrow morning at the gate, in fact that's all I want from you." "What about past that? 
I mean, what about my future?" "What future? When you arrive at the gates you'll be given a few basic instructions and then sent to after action.
-----
You say "Oh. Okay, I guess...?"
-----
"That's it. Now, I have to get back to my desk. Have a good evening, Sir Kit." You leave the room with a sigh, wondering what the hell they're going to do with you.
-----
You inexplicable fall asleep right there at the armory, for no better reason than you are homeless and you have been awake for nine days.
-----
You end up resting your head on somebody's shoulder, and fall asleep for no better reason than that. You awaken with a start; somebody has covered you with a blanket. 
You are just about alert enough to notice that the armory is now empty. "You're awake!" A beautiful woman exclaims. You look and see that it's the recruiter.
-----
You say "Oh! Hello, lady! Don't mind me, I just very much wanted to kill you when we first met, but now that I am well-rested, sort of, I feel far better with not killing you."
-----
"Well you're half right, Sir Kit. I wanted to kill you, but just as much as I wanted to kill you, I also wanted to fuck you."
