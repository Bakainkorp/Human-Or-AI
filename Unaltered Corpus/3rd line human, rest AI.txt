You are Talia, a princess living in the kingdom of Larion. You wake up in a big feather bed and hear clamoring outside your door. A knight rushes in to tell you 
that a man and a woman are fighting in the courtyard. You get dressed as quick as you can to stop the wedding of the century. Maybe you can get to the bottom of this before something terrible happens.
"What is going on?!" You ask the feuding couple.
The man raises his hands as if he is the innocent party in all this. "We were just getting ready to get married! Then you burst in here, starkers and... " 
He pauses to look for the right word. "Pornographic!" The woman crosses her arms. 
"Yeah? Well you were having an affair with my husband's wife for years!" The man shrugs. "So?" "So? You're a monster! I'm calling the king!" 
She storms off. The man looks at you hopefully. 
"Will you testify for me, your highness? I promise I will stay faithful to you... erm... I will be faithful to you." You giggle. 
"I'm not sure what you expect me to do, your highness. I am a princess, and a princess doesn't get involved in these kinds of issues. 
The best I can do is tell my father... but I don't know what he'll decide. You should talk to a wizard or something, your highness." He frowns. "
I really appreciate this, miss... ?" "Just Talia is fine." He sighs. "Talia, then. I'm very sorry, Talia.
 I meant no disrespect. It's just that I'm not getting any at all from my current wife.
 I'm fairly certain she's having an affair." "Sorry, but I can't do anything about that.
 You need to talk to the king about this. 
Here, give me your name and title and I'll tell him you're coming. 
He's the only one that can fix these things or at least let you into the kingdom, if you're already a citizen somewhere else. 
You'll have to stay outside the capital, though. I don't think you want to see the king right now..." He gives you a big grin. "I understand. Some other time, then.
 Some other time. 
I'm sure the king will be able to help." You leave him and head to find Dendar. He's just in your court at this time. You tell him the whole story.


"What do you think of all this?" He frowns. 
"Sounds like the woman is just using some weird excuse to stay married to him. If she's been having an affair for so long, it hardly seems worth it, now does it?" "What do you mean?"
He shrugs. 
"Well if she's been having an affair for that long, he probably wouldn't want to risk losing her by getting a divorce so soon after they got married." You think for a moment. 
"So..." He laughs. 
"Yeah, I don't think they'll get a divorce so soon after the wedding! Congratulations on your own wedding!" "Huh." He nods. "Yeah."
You go back to your room and get some more sleep... Yep, it's another boring morning. At least, boring compared to the night before. You do have a decision to make in the morning. 
You could talk to the king now about your fiance or you could wait until later.
Of course, there's also the other woman in the room to think about.
 You decide to talk to the king about your situation and see what he suggests. You head to the royal meeting room, the dining hall, around noon. 
You don't see the king anywhere, but you see his advisor Dendar. "Good afternoon, princess. Have a seat. King Charles is out on an important council. "You nod. 
"Good to know. When is he expected back?" "Anywhere between late afternoon and evening." You sit. After about a half hour, the king enters.
"Ah. My daughter. I heard you wanted to see me?" "Yes, father. I have come here today to tell you that I have accepted the marriage proposal that was made to me yesterday."
He frowns. "Ah, yes. I see. So you've decided to join our kingdom despite your claims that you want to be an independent ruler.
 Good." "No, father. As I said, I have come to tell you that I have accepted your offer, but I am still having some doubts about the marriage. 
I've found no reason so far that would make it a disadvantage for me." "No, of course not." He sits down across from you. 
"You are of the royal family through your... uh... royal princess mother. I don't believe there was a problem with that." "Yes, but my father..." "Your father has no say in these matters.
 I am the one who decides such things. And as you can see, I chose to accept your decision. 
You will be marrying the king. I am the king." You sit silent for a moment. "That's all I wanted to know. When and where will it happen?"
"Well, it should be held sooner rather than later seeing as it's winter and all. I was thinking the wedding will be in the spring, but if you'd prefer to wait, that's fine too."
"... It doesn't matter when. I'll be ready to go at a moment's notice." "Ah... well, we will have time for you to get prepared then."
You nod. "That will be fine.
 Dendar, tell the royal wedding planner to start setting up the rooms for the big event." "Got it, princess." The king stands, and you do likewise. "
Then, you are dismissed. I have other matters to attend to." "Yes, father." You walk out of the room, and Dendar closes the door behind you. "So...
 you're going through with the marriage?" "Yes," you reply. "Wow. You really went all out for this, huh?" "Yes, I did."
"Well, congratulations on your new status." "Thank you." You walk to the princess and give her a hug. She hugs you back. "I have to say, this all feels weird,"
 she says. "I know it probably will for a while. Just take things as they come, and don't worry about what others might be saying. There's no need to worry.
 You'll be fine." "I know. Thanks for this. I appreciate it." You nod. "Anytime.
 Well, I should get back to Windblade. We're leaving tomorrow morning." "She's really going to help you attack the kingdom?"
"Yes, Dendar, she really is." The next morning, you get one last hug from the princess. You feel a little emotional as well. You blink back your tears and say goodbye, then leave.
You don't cry when you board the airship. You're a bundle of nerves and happy anticipation for what lies ahead.
You sit down in between Windy and Flameflower. After a short flight, you arrive at an island. 
It's quite large, and the only town on it is called Norman Island. "So, Norman Island... it isn't English, is it?" Flameflower asks.
"No. It's an English name for a Norman town," you reply. "Oh, right. Sort of makes sense, seeing as the Normans dominated everything at the time," Flameflower says.
