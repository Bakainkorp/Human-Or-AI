You are George, a person trying to stay sane during a global quarantine. You have a ton of free time and a rubik's cube that you will never finish. You are bored out of your mind and have run out of things to do. But then you notice in the corner of your room something strange...
You see a worn out camcorder sitting on a box. You haven't seen one of these things in years so you decide to take it with you to get something to do.
-----
You pick up the camcorder and start making videos.
It's mostly of stuff that you'd normally do around the house, but whatever works to help you stay sane.
You use it while you're cooking, doing menial school work, doing actual work, and sleeping.
There's nothing else to do, so why do anything else?
You decide to upload its footage onto the internet.
-----
 You end up getting a few hits, which makes you happy. However, it wasn't the most popular video on the site and most people don't watch past the first minute or so.
-----
Shrugging it off, you make more videos anyway. It's not like you have anything better to do.
The world is on fire. This is the most boring apocalypse.
Your next videos garner more attention. Everyone is probably bored out of their minds.
Just like you.
You go to bed, and wake up to what you believe is the next day, but is it really? Who knows?
-----
 What matters is that it's later, which means you should be making a new video... You put the camcorder back in your box of "treasure" and go to sleep.
-----
Next day, you do the same exact thing. Make more videos about nothing, and upload it all.
More traction, that's good!
Less traction, that's not so good. Whatever makes your brain happy.
Whatever makes your brain spit out the feel-good hormone.
Whatever makes the number on the window to the rest of the world you call a screen go up.
-----
Whatever makes the number on the window to the world that is a person you call a mom go down. Whatever it is, you're going with it.
-----
Words on the screen begin to blur together.
The videos you make are terrible. Your home isn't exciting, and the only thing changing in there is you.
And even you, you're slowly turning into a blob from all the food you're eating.
But you can't go outside. Outside is too dangerous.
You're safe inside. And as long as that's the case, you're staying inside.
-----
There's nothing to do but stay inside and get fat. Eventually, the world ends. You die happy in your own filth.
-----
A small blip of happiness. It's finally over.
You hear an alarm clock ring. Your eyes open.
Turning over onto your side, you see your alarm clock. It isn't over. You're not dead. You're unfortunately still alive.
And yet again, nothing has actually changed. Maybe you should make a video about your thoughts?
You turn your camcorder to yourself, and you start documenting the endless minutes and hours and days and weeks of absolutely nothing happening.
-----
Now that the world has ended, you have time to do this. What were you thinking when the world ended? Is this a new beginning for you? Let's watch and find out!
-----
You do your best to be excited, but there's nothing to be excited about.
The world is under the world's smallest match, burning over slower than a snail.
What's the point with this existence, if only to be bored.
You need excitement, but nothing here excites.
You need freedom, but nothing here is free.
-----
You need to move, but nothing can. You're stuck in a room with nothing to do. You need to eat, but you have no hunger.
-----
You lie back down onto your bed. You feel like a bag of dirty laundry.
You had dreams and aspirations once.
Back when the world was alive, back when getting sick was a common occurrence, and something that you can quickly recover from.
Those days are long gone.
You look over at your bowling trophies. You wish you could go bowling now.
-----
You wish you could just travel back in time and not turn off your phone, so you could get out of bed on time.
-----
Your phone connects you to the rest of the world. Everyone else is doing this too.
But everyone else is going through the exact same thing.
Boredom.
Boredom.
Boredom.
-----
BOREDOM. You need to do something. Maybe that's it. You need to do something... No, that's not it. Something else. You need to...
-----
You go onto your computer.
You look up interesting facts about random animals. Does that give you fulfillment?
No, it doesn't. At least it's interesting.
You shrug and lie back down on your bed.
You can feel the outline of your own body on the bed.
-----
 You're laying on your back. Just as you close your eyes to get some more sleep, your phone starts ringing. It's an unfamiliar number. Your eyes pop wide open. "Hello?" You answer.
-----
The voice on the other side is nice.
It sounds like a woman.
Her voice is sweet and soothing to listen to.
You don't remember what you talked about.
But you know that you talked for hours and hours. It was the closest you've ever felt to company.
-----
 You forgot that phone conversations can last so long. It felt like you were talking to a real person, not just someone that's on the internet.
-----
Her name was Katherine.
She was bored.
So she called all the numbers in chronological order.
Just by chance, you were the first person to answer her.
And immediately, a spark has been lit between you two.
-----
She loves the movie "The Matrix". She loves the television show "Twin Peaks". She loves the novel "Fight Club". She wants to go to Disneyland, but her mother won't let her.
-----
She has a pet dog named Sparky.
Her middle name is Stacy, but she hates being called that.
Her birthday is July 8.
Her lifelong dream is to be a movie star.
She enjoys drinking soda in the morning.
-----
She wants to know where you're going to be so she can meet up with you there. Is that everything? Well, there's a lot more, but these seem like solid facts.
-----
She's wonderful.
You've never seen her, but you know you're in love.
But the bitter pill was always on the tip of your tongue.
As long as quarantine was going on, you were never going to meet her.
But you want to believe, and you told her where you lived.
-----
Time passed, maybe a week or two. Out of the blue, there was an announcement to the community over the intercom. Everyone had to report to their respective solid compounds immediately. Nobody was told why.
-----
Not like it mattered to you, anyway.
You're living on your compound. You never left.
In all of your boredom, there was a fear to leave outside.
You don't want to die, even though you aren't really living.
So you ignored the announcement, and continued as if nothing happened. And nothing did happen.
-----
Your compound is your hell. The sky is an eternal grey. The ground is cold, at times too cold for human comfort. You've got everything you need right here.
-----
Back into your bed you go.
Back to your phone to talk to Katherine about nothing and everything.
But the one day she doesn't answer was the day where everyone was to report to their compound.
And a knock on your door.
You look through the peephole, and you see a woman with fiery red hair standing outside, covering her face with a mask.
-----
It's her. You open the door. "Hello, Adam."
-----
You nearly double over in laughter.
Laughing hurts. It's been a long time since you last really enjoyed yourself and let out a hearty laugh.
You forgot you introduced yourself as Adam instead of George.
Now is a good time to rectify that matter.
"Katherine, my name is George. It's a pleasure to finally meet you in person.
-----
 Please, come in." She comes in and sits on the couch. "I don't think we've actually covered each other's names yet." You say."Oh, right. I'm sorry.
-----
You sit next to her.
For the first time, your couch felt fairly cramped.
But that was a good thing, as far as you were concerned.
"My name is not Katherine. My name is actually Penelope." She says.
"And my name is not Adam. It's George." You say. You two awkwardly laugh, but it feels so liberating.
-----
 You've been bottling up all this energy from the inside. "So, George. Where do you work?" Penelope asks.
-----
"Where everyone works. On the computer."
Giggle. Her laugh is making your heart flutter.
You lightly touch her hands.
Her eyes grow wider, as they stare into yours.
"I haven't felt another person's touch in so long, George." She says.
-----
"I know what you mean. Although, I don't suppose we'll feel similar passion towards each other all the time, will we?" She looks down, and her eyes begin to water.
-----
"I only just met you, but..." She starts.
Her feet shuffle around.
Her face is beet red.
You can feel her pulse on her hand.
She's nervous. But she isn't letting go of you.
-----
"I know I'm in love with you, George." You don't say a word. You just pull her into your chest and hug her. The only word that comes to mind is...
-----
Happy.
Happy is all you feel.
Happy is all you can experience.
Happy.
An alarm clock rings. 
Your eyes open. 
You were dreaming. 
All those memories. 
They were just a dream. 
Penelope isn't real.
And it's nothing more than the next day.
