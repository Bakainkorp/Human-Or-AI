You are Detective Sadman, a detective living in Chicago. You have a pistol and a police badge. You enter the forest where you believe the criminal you're searching for fled to. Suddenly, 
a gunshot is heard.You turn around and see the fleeing criminal, who has just shot you with his rifle. You fall down and hold your badge out in hopes that this will prevent him from fleeing any further.
-----
You say "Matthew L. Donovan, you don't need to do this! It's okay that your killer is still at large. But killing his entire family is not okay! If you come peacefully, we can properly settle everything, and you can be at peace with your life."
-----
You do not expect this to work, but you have to try.
"Matthew L. ...Detective" The man turns and aims his rifle at you. "Detective what? I don't know any..." "You know this is not necessary!"
He looks up towards the trees and aims. "Not necessary? Your wife is a potential killer, that's what you said! I'm going to shoot you and mount your head on my wall."
-----
You say "Matthew, my wife is dead. Of course she's a potential killer, she nearly killed me with cyanide and a double-barrel shotgun. But I'm still here, fighting for justice. You can, too, you know?"

-----
He lowers his rifle. "For real?" He lowers his gun all the way and steps forward. He is very close now. "Give me the badge." You hand it over.
-----
You say "What I'm saying is genuine. I don't want any more needless bloodshed."
-----
"You are a sincere man." He says, looking you up and down. "But the badge? You look like a cop.""I am a cop." you insist.
-----
You say "Or rather, I'm a detective. I'm not really supposed to look like a typical police officer."

-----
"I don't care. You look like a cop. You talk like a cop. You even smell like a cop. You're a cop.""I'm not really supposed to..."
-----
You shrug, and sit down on a tree stump. You pat another tree stump next to you, motioning Matthew to sit down and talk about his life.
-----
"What?" Matthew asks, confused. "I don't get it." "Just sit down, for god's sake! I'm a police officer. Are you just going to shoot me on the spot?"
-----
You rest your hand on your gun, but you do your best to make sure it looks like you're still vulnerable to gain Matthew's trust.

-----
"Look, I'm not here to kill you," You say. "If anything, I'm here to try and arrest you." "Arrest me?" Matthew says.
-----
You say "Okay, not arrest you. But I want to know what's going on. I want to know why you killed my partner and killed your wife's family."
-----
Matthew lets out a dry chuckle. He sits down on the stump, and motions for you to do the same. You comply, and he begins to speak.
"I killed your partner because he was being a complete dumb-dumb. That's what happened.""What?
-----
You say "I mean, he's pretty dumb, but he has the reflexes of a top-level esports gamer. How were you able to shoot him?"
-----

"I used a silencer. And I was far enough away that he didn't hear the shot before he felt the impact of the bullet.
-----
You nod silently, gesturing with your hands for Matthew to continue speaking.
-----
"The other guy, the one I killed?" "He was reaching into his glove compartment." "Glove compartment?
"Yup." "That's it?" "Yep." "Why were you reaching into the glove compartment of a car?" "I didn't feel like getting shot." "Why not?"
-----
"'Why not,' the detective asks the criminal. I'm sorry I don't want to be riddled with bullets, but that's how life is. I don't suppose you want to be shot like that other guy." Matthew says, with a hint of sarcasm.

-----
"Of course not." "Well, then get your hands off my neck." You stand up, and detach your hand from Matthew's neck.
-----
You say "Sorry about that. Say, I know you don't particularly trust me, but do you wanna go to Denny's? It's pretty close to here, about a ten minute drive. We can go in my cruiser/"
-----
"Nah. I've eaten worse than cold meatloaf." "Come on! Don't say things like that!" "I just killed two guys, detective. I don't have much emotional capacity left."
-----
You say "Two guys and your wife. I guess that makes sense. You'd practically need to be a serial killer to not like Denny's. But what about Wendy's? They got that nice 4 for $4.44 after all."

-----
"Deal with it." "Fine, but you're buying." "Fair enough." You drive to Dennys.
-----
"Hey, I thought you said we were going to Wendy's!" Matthew exclaims. "Yeah, but I like Denny's so we're eating at Denny's." You respond.
"Sheesh, I'd rather just go to jail at this point. Denny's is cruel and unusual punishment."
-----
"Trust me, it's better than jail." You arrive at Denny's. 
You and Matthew walk inside. "This is a pretty upscale place. I thought we were just going to eat cold meat in a dirty room." Matthew says.
"I like to make an entrance.
-----
And hey, this is the best Denny's I know. Say, I'll go get us a table." You say.

-----
As you head to the hostess stand, Matthew asks a question. "Why don't you just call in an order and we can go eat at the HQ?
-----
" You frown. "I like this place." Walking towards the hostess, she warmly greets you. "Ah, Detective Sadman. Welcome back! Table for-" She cuts off and looks at Matthew. "Two..." She says, droning off and filled with dread. 
-----
Uncomfortable, she looks at you. "And..." She continues, trying to find a table for two. Desperately, she looks at you.
-----
You say "I'll take the one in the back room, if you don't mind."

-----
"Sure thing, sir." She leads you to the table, and shows you the menus. "Alright, what would you like to drink?"
-----
You say "Ah, actually, just get me a coffee for right now. I'm gonna use the bathroom first. Please help out our dear friend Matthew, okay?"
-----
"Of course!" A few minutes later... "Alright, now that my coffee is ready, I'll be expecting my food soon, understood?" "Yes, sir."
-----
You get up and go to the bathroom, where you decide to check on your gun to see if it's loaded and working.

-----
You check to make sure your gun is loaded and the safety is off. Good, it seems to be working.
-----
You walk behind Matthew, who is sipping on a glass of soda. "See you around, buddy." You say, holding the gun towards the back of his head, and pulling the trigger.
-----
The gun is loaded. You quickly turn around, and walk out of the bathroom. You approach Matthew with gun ready to fire... 
But Matthew isn't there. He must've already ran off. You wait for a while, but he never shows up.
-----
You say "That's unfortunate. I have to chase him before he gets away for real this time."

-----
You walk out of the restaurant, and spot a familiar figure. It's the target of your surprise attack: Matthew. "Oh look, it's you!" You exclaim.
-----
You pull out your loaded, aim towards Matthew, and fire as fast as you can.
-----
The gun bucks and explodes in your hands, as burns cover your arms, face, and forehead. You fall to the ground. You see Matthew walking away. "What are you doing!? Our target is escaping!!"
-----
You turn around, and you see the Hostess pulling out a gun and aiming towards Matthew. You have come to the realization that he has tampered with your gun. You are too wounded to get up and chase after him.

-----
"Aw, isn't this fun?" He says, raising his hands. "I had no idea the cops would be so incompetent. I'm untrustworthy? What, am I a criminal now?"
-----
You say "Always have been, Matthew. Always have been."
-----
You let the words sink in for Matthew. A slight grin appears on his face. "You know what this makes us, don't you? We make History." He says proudly. He holds up a finger.
-----
The hostess fires her gun, but the gun also explodes in her hands.

-----
"Ah, excellent." 
"What now? What happens next?" You ask nervously. "I don't know." Matthew says. "You tell me. What happened, before you were so rudely interrupted?"
-----
You say "How did you know that this was a booby trap?"
-----
"I didn't." He says.
-----
You say "Then how did you tamper with our guns?"

-----
"I didn't." "Uh huh.
-----
I don't believe that. Not for a second. And to think I confided with you in the forest. And brought you to my favorite restaurant!" You exclaim.
-----
"Guess you would have preferred I wanted to kill you?" Matthew asks. He's got a point.
-----
You try to get up and charge at him, but the wounds and injuries from the explosion prevent you from making much headway.

-----
You manage to get your foot off the ground, and push yourself up. You take a step forward, but then fall face first into the grass. You're severely injured, and you know it.
-----
Matthew laughs and steals your car, leaving you and the fellow officer in disguise wounded.
You resign from the force the next day.
-----
Your abject failure still haunting you, you resolve to one day get your revenge on Matthew L. Donovan.
Your life continues as an average, if aimless, one.
-----
You pick up some work as a private detective, but solving only menial and petty crimes prove to be quite boring and unfulfilling.

-----
You try working as a janitor, a police officer, a security guard and a telemarketer. All of these jobs last a month before you decide it's not worth it and quit.
-----
Deep in your heart you already know. As long as Matthew continues to be at large, you won't ever be able to be content with the life you have now.
-----
Though you haven't seen or heard from him in years, you still hold a burning hatred towards him. You resolve that one day, he'll pay for what he did to you and the world.
You move to Alabama to live with your sister, but it's not the same as having your own place. She works all the time, so you find a job at the grocery store she works at.
To make the time pass, you try to focus on your procuring skills, playing your music as loud as you can and dancing as much as you can.
One day while putting away some products, you see a man enter the store. He's wearing a business suit, and carries a briefcase.
-----
You know that it's a little suspicious to carry a briefcase into a grocery store. You watch him carefully, while still putting items onto the shelf.
-----
The man walks straight to the office at the back of the store. You peek around the corner, and the man appears to be putting up posters for a play the next night.
-----
You examine the posters for the play, only to recognize the officer who was with you during the fabled Denny's incident, front stage and center.
-----
 You turn, and walk towards the office. You open the door, and see that the man is cleaning out the newsprint and turning over the posters. He smiles at you.
-----
You say "Were those posters in your suitcase?"
-----
"Nah, I stole them off the wall at the high school." He says.
-----
You say "I see. I'm pretty sure that's a felony."
-----
"Probably." He shrugs. "But it's a first degree misdemeanor for stealing from a high school, so what the hell. You start laughing.
"What's so funny?" "I was THAT guy! I stole the posters off the wall of my high school." You continue laughing.
